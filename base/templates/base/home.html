                    <h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p> It's almost been two years since I got into coding and a year since I became a full-time dev.
                    I started writing this article merely as a self-reflection exercise. 
                    But I thought maybe someone who's in a similar position as I am or is just starting to code right now might find some of my experiences useful or interesting.</p>
                
                    <p>I plan on talking about a lot of things here. I'll go over everything from my background and how I switched careers at almost thirty to how I learned to code and chose my tech stack.
                    I'll also discuss what I plan on learning in the future and why, 
                    along with some general advice and my overall feelings and thoughts about this first year of professional work.</p>

                    <p>After almost two years of supporting my system at the lab I'm ready to learn something new.
